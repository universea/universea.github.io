<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. Candiate in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Xinyu Liu](https://liulab.mie.utoronto.ca/). 

My research lies at the intersection of **micro-/nano robotics** and **artificial intelligence** --with a special focus on biomedical applications. My research interests include  **computer vision**, **3D reconstruction**, **generative models**, **reinforcement learning**, **LLM agents**, and **autonomous robot scientist**.
